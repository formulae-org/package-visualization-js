# package-visualization-js

Visualization package for the [Fōrmulæ](https://formulae.org) programming language.

Fōrmulæ is also a software framework for visualization, edition and manipulation of complex expressions, from many fields. The code for an specific field —i.e. arithmetics— is encapsulated in a single unit called a Fōrmulæ **package**.

This repository contains the source code for the **visualization package**. It contains visualizations and reducers to change the appearance of expressions

The GitHub organization [formulae-org](https://github.com/formulae-org) encompasses the source code for the rest of packages, as well as the [web application](https://github.com/formulae-org/formulae-js).

<!--
